Blockchain Lab, India is a research arm of Auxesis Group. The lab has been established in September
2017 to promote and grow the Blockchain ecosystem in country. Lab is working in a multiple spheres
including high end product development, organising seminars and conferences across the country, training
students and corporates for implementing in-production applications with Blockchain Technology.
This internship program is designed to help senior year management students from various background to
get a business grasp over Blockchain Technology, recognising its potential for various industry, defining
frameworks for when and when not to use Blockchain, recognising industry specific use cases, architecting
business solution and its implementation for Enterprises.</p>

                            <p class="infotext">Identity management is a broad administrative area that deals with identifying individuals in a system (such
                            as a country, a network, or an enterprise) and controlling their access to resources within that system by
                            associating user rights and restrictions with the established identity.
                            In today’s system the identity management process is centralised, prone to failure, easily counterfeited and
                            highly compromise users privacy. Blockchain Technology has shown a potential on how this process can be
                            improved and users privacy can be better controlled by users itself.
                            The project program will take students through various process involved in solution architecting and cover

                                Financial instruments are monetary contracts between parties. They can be created, traded, modified and
                                settled. They can be cash (currency), evidence of an ownership interest in an entity (share), or a contractual
                                right to receive or deliver cash (bond).
                                This has been closely seen a number of times on how centralisation and inherent opaqueness in financial
                                processes has led to global economy crisis. With a more transparent demand with different regulators and
                                transparent governance system, Blockchain has appeared to help big time in enabling a more transparent
                                yet private and secure transactions / contracts to be enabled.<br>
                                The project program will take students through various process involved in solution architecting and cover
                                following aspects:
                              <br></p>

                          Technology for interested students. The session will cover different use cases and brain storming over
                          implementation of DLT. This practice will ensure participants to choose their project carefully.
                          Further, use case specific sessions will be organised to help students kick start on their project development.
                          Guides will be provided to help students receive a responsive feedback on their problems. Further, biweekly
                          compulsory meeting sessions will ensure a successful execution of the program.
